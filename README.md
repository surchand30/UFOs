# UFOs

## Overview:

This project involved analyzing UFO sightings data stored in a JSON file format and making it the foundation of a user interactive web page. The idea was to parse the data from the JSON file format into a table using Javascript and access it using a webpage created using HTML. The webpage was created in such a way that the user should be able to filter through and view the data from the website.

## Results:

The UFO sightings webpage was created to provide an easy way for users to filter through the JSON data and analyze the data on a web browser.
